summary:    A Python Chess Engine with Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Move Ordering, and Quiescence Search

When I started this project on holiday, all I had was my phone, so using the Pythonista app, I pushed forward. This constraint posed a _unique_ challenge, but one I was happy to undertake! This chess program is played in the console, and moves are represented by specifying the start and end spaces, such as __a2 -> b3__.

I started this project by reading some old blog posts (unfortunately, I’ve since lost the link) from which I learned not only the minimax technique but also how to extend it to improve speed and quality. These extensions include bitboards, alpha-beta pruning, move ordering, and quiescence search.

I began by implementing the core minimax algorithm using the negamax variant. After that, I was able to extend the solution with additional features.

The __ChessGame.py__ program serves as the entry point for the code. It utilizes the negamax function in __Negamax.py__ to determine the best move. __Negamax.py__ calls functions in __ChessBoard.py__ to represent the chess board, move pieces, and compute a static evaluation.

## ChessGame.py

__ChessGame.py__ provides the overall game loop: move the AI player, display the board, move the human player, display again. You can also pass in a string that represents the starting board, allowing you to continue an unfinished game.

{% highlight python lineanchors %}

Display(board)  
while move != "STOP":

    # Decide on move  
    minimaxMove = negamax(board, maxDepth, 1, 2, -10000, 10000)  
    
    # Make move  
    board = Move(board, minimaxMove[0], minimaxMove[1])

    # Display the new board  
    Display(board)
    
    # Get player input  
    inpList = input().split()
    
    . . .
    
    # Make move  
    board = Move(board, move[0], move[1])

    # Display the new board  
    Display(board)

{% endhighlight %}

## Negamax.py

__Negamax.py__ implements the minimax algorithm using negamax. It follows the classic structure for such implementations, with one notable addition: checkmate detection. The __GenerateLegalMoves()__ function indicates a checkmate situation by returning "C".

{% highlight python lineanchors %}

def negamax(board, depth, side, opposite):  
    global count, maxDepth  
    moves = GenerateLegalMoves(board, side, opposite, depth, maxDepth)  
    if moves == "C":  
        return "C"  
    if depth == 0:  
        count += 1  
        return EvaluateNegamax(board, side)  
    max = -10000000000  
    maxMove = ()  
    for i in range(len(moves[0])):  
        score = negamax(Move(board, moves[0][i], moves[1][i]), depth-1, opposite, side)  
        if score == "C":  
            continue  
        score = -score  
        if score > max:  
            max = score  
            maxMove = (moves[0][i], moves[1][i])  
    if depth == maxDepth:  
        print(count)  
        print(maxMove, max)  
        return maxMove  
    if max == -10000000000:  
        return -1000  
    return max  

{% endhighlight %}

## ChessBoard.py

__ChessBoard.py__ provides the core functionality and rules for the chessboard. It generates possible moves for each piece given the current board state. For example, here is the move generator for knights, __KnightMoves()__:

{% highlight python lineanchors %}

def KnightMoves(board, x, y, side, opposite):  
    KnightAdjustments = [(2,1),(1,2),(-1,2),(-2,1),(-2,-1),(-1,-2),(1,-2),(2,-1)]  
    Moves = []  
    if side == 1:  
        for adjust in KnightAdjustments:  
            move = (adjust[0] + x, adjust[1] + y)  
            moveEnd = ValueOf(board, move[0], move[1], side)  
            if moveEnd == 0 or moveEnd > 6:  
                Moves.append(move)  
        return Moves  
    elif side == 2:  
        for adjust in KnightAdjustments:  
            move = (adjust[0] + x, adjust[1] + y)  
            moveEnd = ValueOf(board, move[0], move[1], side)  
            if moveEnd <= 6:  
                Moves.append(move)  
        return Moves

{% endhighlight %}

It also provides static evaluation of the board state. This function evaluates how advantageous the current board is for a given side. Here is the __EvaluateNegamax.py__ function:

{% highlight python lineanchors %}

def EvaluateNegamax(board, side):  
    global wBoard  
    Material = [0,1,5,3,3,9,0,-1,-5,-3,-3,-9,0]  
    MaterialPosition = [0,3,3,2.75,4,0,0,-3,-3,-2.75,-4,0,0]  
    Value = 0  
    addition = 0  
    for y in range(8):  
        for x in range(8):  
            piece = board[y][x]  
            Value += Material[piece]  
            Value += MaterialPosition[piece] * wBoard[y][x] / 100  
    if side == 1:  
        return Value  
    elif side == 2:  
        return -Value  

{% endhighlight %}

## Enhancements

Implementing __alpha-beta pruning__ was relatively straightforward since it’s well-documented and only requires minor changes to the basic negamax formula. However, testing it to ensure it worked properly took considerable time.

Implementing __quiescence search__, which extends the search when the minimax algorithm stops at a capture move, was more challenging. The goal is to continue searching until reaching a "quiet" position with no captures. This required significant rewrites of the existing negamax code to accommodate the additional evaluation step.

This bot has managed to beat a few of my friends but lost to more skilled players.

### Future Plans:

- Add support for en passant moves
- Investigate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms
