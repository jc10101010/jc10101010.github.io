This might be the __strangest__ program I have every worked on.

## Why is it important?

This language would be the first step in building a whole computer in Turing Machine code. And such a computer
although it may be slow would be __platform independant__, and would __run identically on any Turing Complete device__.

## What are the roles of Tape, States and the Language

## What is a Hub program and why is it useful?

blah

## Why does there need to be a language?

blah

## How does the language actually work?

### Future Plans: 
  * Add an error handler for incorrectly written lines
  * Write the code required for multiplicatiom, subtraction, division
